## 2. Required Problems

In this section, you are required to complete the problems below and submit your code to `Contest hw01` in our [OJ website](http://114.212.84.18) as instructed in lab00 to get your answer scored.

### Problem 1: A Plus Abs B (100pts)

Fill in the blanks in the following function for adding `a` to the absolute value of `b`, without calling `abs`. You may **not** modify any of the provided code other than the two blanks.

```python
from operator import add, sub

def a_plus_abs_b(a, b):
    """Return a+abs(b), but without calling abs.

    >>> a_plus_abs_b(2, 3)
    5
    >>> a_plus_abs_b(2, -3)
    5
    >>> # a check that you didn't change the return statement!
    >>> import inspect, re
    >>> re.findall(r'^\s*(return .*)', inspect.getsource(a_plus_abs_b), re.M)
    ['return h(a, b)']
    """
    if b >= 0:
        h = _____
    else:
        h = _____
    return h(a, b)
```

You can use doctest to test your code:

    $ python -m doctest hw01.py


### Problem 2: Two of Three (100pts)

Write a function that takes three positive numbers and returns the sum of the squares of the two smallest numbers. **Use only a single line for the body of the function.**

```python
def two_of_three(x, y, z):
    """Return a*a + b*b, where a and b are the two smallest members of the
    positive numbers x, y, and z.

    >>> two_of_three(1, 2, 3)
    5
    >>> two_of_three(5, 3, 1)
    10
    >>> two_of_three(10, 2, 8)
    68
    >>> two_of_three(5, 5, 5)
    50
    >>> # check that your code consists of nothing but an expression (this docstring)
    >>> # a return statement
    >>> import inspect, ast
    >>> [type(x).__name__ for x in ast.parse(inspect.getsource(two_of_three)).body[0].body]
    ['Expr', 'Return']
    """
    return _____
```

> Hint: Consider using the `max` or `min` function:
> 
> ```python
> >>> max(1, 2, 3)
> 3
> >>> min(-1, -2, -3)
> -3
> ```

### Problem 3: Largest Factor (100pts)
Write a function that takes an integer `x` that is **greater than 1** and returns the largest integer that is smaller than `x` and evenly divides `x`.

```python
def largest_factor(x):
    """Return the largest factor of x that is smaller than x.

    >>> largest_factor(15) # factors are 1, 3, 5
    5
    >>> largest_factor(80) # factors are 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 16, 20, 40
    40
    >>> largest_factor(13) # factor is 1 since 13 is prime
    1
    """
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"
```

> Hint: To check if `b` evenly divides `a`, you can use the expression `a % b == 0`, which can be read as, "the remainder of dividing `a` by `b` is 0."

### Problem 4: If Function vs Statement (100pts)

Let's try to write a function that does the same thing as an `if` statement.

```python
def if_function(condition, true_result, false_result):
    """Return true_result if condition is a true value, and
    false_result otherwise.

    >>> if_function(True, 2, 3)
    2
    >>> if_function(False, 2, 3)
    3
    >>> if_function(3==2, 3+2, 3-2)
    1
    >>> if_function(3>2, 3+2, 3-2)
    5
    """
    if condition:
        return true_result
    else:
        return false_result
```

Despite the doctests above, this function actually does *not* do the same thing as an `if` statement in all cases. To prove this fact, write functions `c`, `t`, and `f` such that `with_if_statement` prints the number `6`, but `with_if_function` prints both `5` and `6`.

```python
def with_if_statement():
    """
    >>> result = with_if_statement()
    6
    >>> print(result)
    None
    """
    if c():
        return t()
    else:
        return f()

def with_if_function():
    """
    >>> result = with_if_function()
    5
    6
    >>> print(result)
    None
    """
    return if_function(c(), t(), f())

def c():
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"

def t():
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"

def f():
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"
```

> Hint: If you are having a hard time identifying how an `if` statement and `if_function` differ, consider the [rules of evaluation for `if` statements](http://composingprograms.com/pages/15-control.html#conditional-statements) and [call expressions](http://composingprograms.com/pages/12-elements-of-programming.html#call-expressions).

### Problem 5: Hailstone (100pts)

Douglas Hofstadter's Pulitzer-prize-winning book, *GÃ¶del*, *Escher*, *Bach*, poses the following mathematical puzzle.

1. Pick a positive integer `x` as the start.
2. If `x` is even, divide it by 2.
3. If `x` is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.
4. Continue this process until `x` is 1.

The number `x` will travel up and down but eventually end at 1 (at least for all numbers that have ever been tried -- nobody has ever proved that the sequence will terminate). Analogously, a hailstone travels up and down in the atmosphere before eventually landing on earth.

> **Breaking News** (or at least the closest thing to that in math). There has been a [recent development](https://www.quantamagazine.org/mathematician-terence-tao-and-the-collatz-conjecture-20191211/) in the hailstone conjecture that shows that almost all numbers will eventually get to 1 if you repeat this process. This isn't a complete proof but a major breakthrough.

This sequence of values of `x` is often called a Hailstone sequence. Write a function that takes a single argument with formal parameter name `x`, prints out the hailstone sequence starting at `x`, and returns the number of steps in the sequence:

```python
def hailstone(x):
    """Print the hailstone sequence starting at x and return its
    length.

    >>> a = hailstone(10)
    10
    5
    16
    8
    4
    2
    1
    >>> a
    7
    """
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"
```

Hailstone sequences can get quite long! Try 27. What's the longest you can find?

### Problem 6: Falling Factorial (100pts)

Let's write a function `falling`, which is a "falling" factorial that takes two arguments, `n` and `k`, and returns the product of `k` consecutive numbers, starting from `n` and working downwards. (This problem is an advanced version of Problem 2, Lab 01.)

```python
def falling(n, k):
    """Compute the falling factorial of n to depth k.

    >>> falling(6, 3)  # 6 * 5 * 4
    120
    >>> falling(4, 3)  # 4 * 3 * 2
    24
    >>> falling(4, 1)  # 4
    4
    >>> falling(4, 0)
    1
    """
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"
```

### Problem 7: Double Eights (100pts)

Write a function that takes in a number and determines if the digits contain two adjacent 8s. (Reviewing Problem 4 and 5 in Lab 01 might be helpful here!)

```python
def double_eights(n):
    """Return true if n has two adjacent eights in a row.
    
    >>> double_eights(8)
    False
    >>> double_eights(88)
    True
    >>> double_eights(2882)
    True
    >>> double_eights(880088)
    True
    >>> double_eights(12345)
    False
    >>> double_eights(80808080)
    False
    """
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"
```
