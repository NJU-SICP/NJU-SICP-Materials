## 2. Review

Consult this section if you need a refresher on the material for this lab. It's okay to skip directly to the questions and refer back here should you get stuck.

### 2.1 Nonlocal

We say that a variable defined in a frame is *local* to that frame. A variable is **nonlocal** to a frame if it is defined in the environment that the frame belongs to but not the frame itself, i.e. in its parent or ancestor frame.

So far, we know that we can access variables in parent frames:

```python
def make_adder(x):
    """ Returns a one-argument function that returns the result of
    adding x and its argument. """
    def adder(y):
        return x + y
    return adder
```

Here, when we call `make_adder`, we create a function `adder` that is able to look up the name `x` in `make_adder`'s frame and use its value.

However, we haven't been able to *modify* variable in parent frames. Consider the following function:

```python
def make_withdraw(balance):
    """Returns a function which can withdraw
    some amount from balance

    >>> withdraw = make_withdraw(50)
    >>> withdraw(25)
    25
    >>> withdraw(25)
    0
    """
    def withdraw(amount):
        if amount > balance:
            return "Insufficient funds"
        balance = balance - amount
        return balance
    return withdraw
```

The inner function `withdraw` attempts to update the variable `balance` in its parent frame. Running this function's doctests, we find that it causes the following error:

```
UnboundLocalError: local variable 'balance' referenced before assignment
```

Why does this happen? When we execute an assignment statement, remember that we are either creating a new binding in our current frame or we are updating an old one in the current frame. For example, the line `balance = ...` in `withdraw`, is creating the local variable balance inside `withdraw`'s frame. This assignment statement tells Python to expect a variable called `balance` inside `withdraw`'s frame, so Python will not look in parent frames for this variable. However, notice that we tried to compute `balance - amount` before the local variable was created! That's why we get the `UnboundLocalError`.

To avoid this problem, we introduce the `nonlocal` keyword. It allows us to update a variable in a parent frame!

> Some important things to keep in mind when using `nonlocal`
> - `nonlocal` cannot be used with global variables (names defined in the global frame).
> If no nonlocal variable is found with the given name, a `SyntaxError` is raised.
> A name that is already local to a frame cannot be declared as nonlocal.

Consider this improved example:

```python
def make_withdraw(balance):
    """Returns a function which can withdraw
    some amount from balance

    >>> withdraw = make_withdraw(50)
    >>> withdraw(25)
    25
    >>> withdraw(25)
    0
    """
    def withdraw(amount):
        nonlocal balance
        if amount > balance:
            return "Insufficient funds"
        balance = balance - amount
        return balance
    return withdraw
```

The line `nonlocal balance` tells Python that `balance` will not be local to this frame, so it will look for it in parent frames. Now we can update `balance` without running into problems.

### 2.2 Iterators

An iterable is any object that can be iterated through, or gone through one element at a time. One construct that we've used to iterate through an iterable is a for loop:

```python
for elem in iterable:
    # do something
```

`for` loops work on any object that is *iterable*. We previously described it as working with any sequence -- all sequences are iterable, but there are other objects that are also iterable! We define an **iterable** as an object on which calling the built-in function `iter` function returns an *iterator*. An iterator is another type of object that allows us to iterate through an iterable by keeping track of which element is next in the sequence.

To illustrate this, consider the following block of code, which does the exact same thing as the `for` statement above:

```python
iterator = iter(iterable)
try:
    while True:
        elem = next(iterator)
        # do something
except StopIteration:
    pass
```

Here's a breakdown of what's happening:

- First, the built-in `iter` function is called on the iterable to create a corresponding *iterator*.
- To get the next element in the sequence, the built-in `next` function is called on this iterator.
- When `next` is called but there are no elements left in the iterator, a `StopIteration` error is raised. In the for loop construct, this exception is caught and execution can continue.

Calling `iter` on an iterable multiple times returns a new iterator each time with distinct states (otherwise, you'd never be able to iterate through a iterable more than once). You can also call `iter` on the iterator itself, which will just return the same iterator without changing its state. However, note that you cannot call `next` directly on an iterable.

Let's see the `iter` and `next` functions in action with an iterable we're already familiar with -- a list.

```
>>> lst = [1, 2, 3, 4]
>>> next(lst)             # Calling next on an iterable
TypeError: 'list' object is not an iterator
>>> list_iter = iter(lst) # Creates an iterator for the list
>>> list_iter
<list_iterator object ...>
>>> next(list_iter)       # Calling next on an iterator
1
>>> next(list_iter)       # Calling next on the same iterator
2
>>> next(iter(list_iter)) # Calling iter on an iterator returns itself
3
>>> list_iter2 = iter(lst)
>>> next(list_iter2)      # Second iterator has new state
1
>>> next(list_iter)       # First iterator is unaffected by second iterator
4
>>> next(list_iter)       # No elements left!
StopIteration
>>> lst                   # Original iterable is unaffected
[1, 2, 3, 4]
```

Since you can call `iter` on iterators, this tells us that that they are also iterables! Note that while all iterators are iterables, the converse is not true - that is, not all iterables are iterators. You can use iterators wherever you can use iterables, but note that since iterators keep their state, they're only good to iterate through an iterable once:

```
>>> list_iter = iter([4, 3, 2, 1])
>>> for e in list_iter:
...     print(e)
4
3
2
1
>>> for e in list_iter:
...     print(e)
```

> **Analogy**: An iterable is like a book (one can flip through the pages) and an iterator for a book would be a bookmark (saves the position and can locate the next page). Calling `iter` on a book gives you a new bookmark independent of other bookmarks, but calling `iter` on a bookmark gives you the bookmark itself, without changing its position at all. Calling `next` on the bookmark moves it to the next page, but does not change the pages in the book. Calling `next` on the book wouldn't make sense semantically. We can also have multiple bookmarks, all independent of each other.

#### 2.2.1 Iterable Uses

We know that lists are one type of built-in iterable objects. You may have also encountered the `range(start, end)` function, which creates an iterable of ascending integers from start (inclusive) to end (exclusive).

```
>>> for x in range(2, 6):
...     print(x)
...
2
3
4
5
```

Ranges are useful for many things, including performing some operations for a particular number of iterations or iterating through the indices of a list.

There are also some built-in functions that take in iterables and return useful results:

- `map(f, iterable)` - Creates iterator over `f(x)` for each `x` in `iterable`
- `filter(f, iterable)` - Creates iterator over `x` for each `x` in `iterable` if `f(x)`
- `zip(iter1, iter2)` - Creates iterator over co-indexed pairs `(x, y)` from both input iterables
- `reversed(iterable)` - Creates iterator over all the elements in the input iterable in - reverse order
- `list(iterable)` - Creates a list containing all the elements in the input iterable
- `tuple(iterable)` - Creates a tuple containing all the elements in the input iterable
- `sorted(iterable)` - Creates a sorted list containing all the elements in the input iterable

### 2.3 Generators

We can create our own custom iterators by writing a *generator function*, which returns a special type of iterator called a **generator**. Generator functions have `yield` statements within the body of the function instead of `return` statements. Calling a generator function will return a generator object and will *not* execute the body of the function.

For example, let's consider the following generator function:

```python
def countdown(n):
    print("Beginning countdown!")
    while n >= 0:
        yield n
        n -= 1
    print("Blastoff!")
```

Calling `countdown(k)` will return a generator object that counts down from `k` to `0`. Since generators are iterators, we can call `iter` on the resulting object, which will simply return the same object. Note that the body is not executed at this point; nothing is printed and no numbers are output.

```python
>>> c = countdown(5)
>>> c
<generator object countdown ...>
>>> c is iter(c)
True
```

So how is the counting done? Again, since generators are iterators, we call `next` on them to get the next element! The first time `next` is called, execution begins at the first line of the function body and continues until the `yield` statement is reached. The result of evaluating the expression in the `yield` statement is returned. The following interactive session continues from the one above.

```
>>> next(c)
Beginning countdown!
5
```

Unlike functions we've seen before in this course, generator functions can remember their state. On any consecutive calls to `next`, execution picks up from the line after the `yield` statement that was previously executed. Like the first call to `next`, execution will continue until the next `yield` statement is reached. Note that because of this, `Beginning countdown!` doesn't get printed again.

```
>>> next(c)
4
>>> next(c)
3
```

The next 3 calls to `next` will continue to yield consecutive descending integers until 0. On the following call, a `StopIteration` error will be raised because there are no more values to yield (i.e. the end of the function body was reached before hitting a `yield` statement).

```
>>> next(c)
2
>>> next(c)
1
>>> next(c)
0
>>> next(c)
Blastoff!
StopIteration
```

Separate calls to `countdown` will create distinct generator objects with their own state. Usually, generators shouldn't restart. If you'd like to reset the sequence, create another generator object by calling the generator function again.

```
>>> c1, c2 = countdown(5), countdown(5)
>>> c1 is c2
False
>>> next(c1)
Beginning countdown!
5
>>> next(c2)
Beginning countdown!
5
```

Here is a summary of the above:

- A generator function has a `yield` statement and returns a *generator object*.
- Calling the `iter` function on a generator object returns the same object without modifying its current state.
- The body of a generator function is not evaluated until `next` is called on a resulting generator object. Calling the `next` function on a generator object computes and returns the next object in its sequence. If the sequence is exhausted, `StopIteration` is raised.
- A generator "remembers" its state for the next `next` call. Therefore,
  - the first `next` call works like this:
    1. Enter the function and run until the line with `yield`.
    2. Return the value in the `yield` statement, but remember the state of the function for future `next` calls.
  - And subsequent `next` calls work like this:
    1. Re-enter the function, start at **the line after the `yield` statement that was previously executed**, and run until the next `yield` statement.
    2. Return the value in the `yield` statement, but remember the state of the function for future `next` calls.
- Calling a generator function returns a brand new generator object (like calling `iter` on an iterable object).
- A generator should not restart unless it's defined that way. To start over from the first element in a generator, just call the generator function again to create a new generator.

Another useful tool for generators is the `yield from` statement (introduced in Python 3.3). `yield from` will yield all values from an iterator or iterable.

```python
>>> def gen_list(lst):
...     yield from lst
...
>>> g = gen_list([1, 2, 3, 4])
>>> next(g)
1
>>> next(g)
2
>>> next(g)
3
>>> next(g)
4
>>> next(g)
StopIteration
```

## 3. Required Problems

In this section, you are required to complete the problems below and submit your code to `Contest lab05` in our [OJ website](http://114.212.84.18) as instructed in lab00 to get your answer scored.

### Nonlocal

#### Problem 1: Make Adder Increasing (100pts)

Write a function which takes in an integer `n` and returns a one-argument function. This function should take in some value `x` and return `n + x` the first time it is called, similar to `make_adder`. The second time it is called, however, it should return `n + x + 1`, then `n + x + 2` the third time, and so on.

```python
def make_adder_inc(n):
    """
    >>> adder1 = make_adder_inc(5)
    >>> adder2 = make_adder_inc(6)
    >>> adder1(2)
    7
    >>> adder1(2) # 5 + 2 + 1
    8
    >>> adder1(10) # 5 + 10 + 2
    17
    >>> [adder1(x) for x in [1, 2, 3]]
    [9, 11, 13]
    >>> adder2(5)
    11
    """
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"
```

Remember to use doctest to test your code:

    $ python -m doctest lab05.py

#### Problem 2: Next Fibonacci (100pts)

Write a function `make_fib` that returns a function that returns the next Fibonacci number each time it is called. (The Fibonacci sequence begins with 0 and then 1, after which each element is the sum of the preceding two.) Use a `nonlocal` statement!

```python
def make_fib():
    """Returns a function that returns the next Fibonacci number
    every time it is called.

    >>> fib = make_fib()
    >>> fib()
    0
    >>> fib()
    1
    >>> fib()
    1
    >>> fib()
    2
    >>> fib()
    3
    >>> fib2 = make_fib()
    >>> fib() + sum([fib2() for _ in range(5)])
    12
    >>> from construct_check import check
    >>> # Do not use lists in your implementation
    >>> check(this_file, 'make_fib', ['List'])
    True
    """
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"
```

### Generators

Generators also allow us to represent infinite sequences, such as the sequence of natural numbers (1, 2, ...).

```python
def naturals():
    """A generator function that yields the infinite sequence of natural
    numbers, starting at 1.

    >>> m = naturals()
    >>> type(m)
    <class 'generator'>
    >>> [next(m) for _ in range(10)]
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
    """
    i = 1
    while True:
        yield i
        i += 1
```

#### Problem 3: Scale (100pts)

Implement the generator function `scale(it, multiplier)`, which yields elements of the given iterable `it`, scaled by `multiplier`. As an extra challenge, try writing this function using a `yield from` statement!

```python
def scale(it, multiplier):
    """Yield elements of the iterable it scaled by a number multiplier.

    >>> m = scale([1, 5, 2], 5)
    >>> type(m)
    <class 'generator'>
    >>> list(m)
    [5, 25, 10]

    >>> m = scale(naturals(), 2)
    >>> [next(m) for _ in range(5)]
    [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
    """
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"
```

#### Problem 4: Hailstone (100pts)

Write a generator that outputs the hailstone sequence from `hw01`.

Here's a quick reminder of how the hailstone sequence is defined:

1. Pick a positive integer `n` as the start.
2. If `n` is even, divide it by 2.
3. If `n` is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.
4. Continue this process until `n` is 1.

For some extra practice, try writing a solution using recursion. Since `hailstone` returns a generator, you can `yield from` a call to `hailstone`!

```python
def hailstone(n):
    """
    >>> for num in hailstone(10):
    ...     print(num)
    ...
    10
    5
    16
    8
    4
    2
    1
    """
    "*** YOUR CODE HERE ***"
```

## 4. Optional Questions

### Question 1: Nonlocal Environment Diagram

> Note: The code in this question is constructed deliberately in a disgusting way as to cement you knowledge about nonlocal environment diagram. It is not a good coding practice and such kinds of meaningless questions will not appear in our mid-term exam. However, it is a good chance to train your brain to interpret code just as Python.

Draw the environment diagram that results from running the following code.

```python
def moon(f):
    sun = 0
    moon = [sun]
    def run(x):
        nonlocal sun, moon
        def sun(sun):
            return [sun]
        y = f(x)
        moon.append(sun(y))
        return moon[0] and moon[1]
    return run

moon(lambda x: moon)(1)
```

After you've done it on your own, generate an environment diagram in [python tutor](http://tutor.cs61a.org/) to check your answer.
