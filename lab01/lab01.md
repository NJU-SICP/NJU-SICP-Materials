## 2. Review

Consult this section if you need a refresher on the material for this lab. It's okay to skip directly to the next section and refer back here should you get stuck.

### 2.1 Functions

If we want to execute a series of statements over and over, we can abstract them away into a function to avoid repeating code.

For example, let's say we want to know the results of multiplying the numbers 1-3 by 3 and then adding 2 to it. Here's one way to do it:

```
>>> 1 * 3 + 2
5
>>> 2 * 3 + 2
8
>>> 3 * 3 + 2
11
```

If we wanted to do this with a larger set of numbers, that'd be a lot of repeated code! Let's write a function to capture this operation given any input number.

```python
def foo(x):
    return x * 3 + 2
```

This function, called `foo`, takes in a single **argument** and will **return** the result of multiplying that argument by 3 and adding 2.

Now we can **call** this function whenever we want this operation to be done:

```
>>> foo(1)
5
>>> foo(2)
8
>>> foo(1000)
3002
```

Applying a function to some arguments is done with a **call expression**.

#### 2.1.1 Call expressions

A call expression applies a function, which may or may not accept arguments. The call expression evaluates to the function's return value.

The syntax of a function call:

```
  add   (    2   ,    3   )
   |         |        |
operator  operand  operand
```

Every call expression requires a set of parentheses delimiting its comma-separated operands.

To evaluate a function call:

1. Evaluate the operator, and then the operands (from left to right).
2. Apply the operator to the operands (the values of the operands).

If an operand is a nested call expression, then these two steps are applied to that inner operand first in order to evaluate the outer operand.

#### 2.1.2 `return` and `print`

Most functions that you define will contain a `return` statement. The `return` statement will give the result of some computation back to the caller of the function and exit the function. For example, the function `square` below takes in a number `x` and returns its square.

```python
def square(x):
    """
    >>> square(4)
    16
    """
    return x * x
```

When Python executes a `return` statement, the function terminates immediately. If Python reaches the end of the function body without executing a `return` statement, it will automatically return `None`.

In contrast, the `print` function is used to display values in the Terminal. This can lead to some confusion between `print` and `return` because calling a function in the Python interpreter will print out the function's return value.

However, unlike a `return` statement, when Python evaluates a `print` expression, the function does *not* terminate immediately.

```
def what_prints():
    print('Hello World!')
    return 'Exiting this function.'
    print('61A is awesome!')

>>> what_prints()
Hello World!
'Exiting this function.'
```

> Notice also that print will display text without the quotes, but return will preserve the quotes.

### 2.2 Control

#### 2.2.1 Boolean Operators

Python supports three boolean operators: `and`, `or`, and `not`:

```
>>> a = 4
>>> a < 2 and a > 0
False
>>> a < 2 or a > 0
True
>>> not (a > 0)
False
```

- `and` evaluates to `True` only if both operands evaluate to `True`. If at least one operand is `False`, then and evaluates to `False`.
- `or` evaluates to `True` if at least one operand evaluates to `True`. If both operands are `False`, then or evaluates to `False`.
- `not` evaluates to `True` if its operand evaluates to `False`. It evaluates to `False` if its operand evaluates to `True`.

What do you think the following expression evaluates to? Try it out in the Python interpreter.

```
>>> True and not False or not True and False
```

It is difficult to read complex expressions, like the one above, and understand how a program will behave. Using parentheses can make your code easier to understand. Python interprets that expression in the following way:

```
>>> (True and (not False)) or ((not True) and False)
```

This is because boolean operators, like arithmetic operators, have an order of operation:

- `not` has the highest priority
- `and`
- `or` has the lowest priority

**Truthy and Falsey Values**: It turns out `and` and `or` work on more than just booleans (`True`, `False`). Python values such as `0`, `None`, `''` (the empty string), and `[]` (the empty list) are considered false values. *All* other values are considered true values.

#### 2.2.2 Short Circuiting

What do you think will happen if we type the following into Python?

```
1 / 0
```

Try it out in Python! You should see a `ZeroDivisionError`. But what about this expression?

```
True or 1 / 0
```

It evaluates to `True` because Python's `and` and `or` operators *short-circuit*. That is, they don't necessarily evaluate every operand.

| Operator | Checks if: | Evaluates from left to right up to: | Example |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| AND | All values are true | The first false value | `False and 1 / 0` evaluates to `False`
| OR | At least one value is true | The first true value | `True or 1 / 0` evaluates to `True` |

Short-circuiting happens when the operator reaches an operand that allows them to make a conclusion about the expression. For example, `and` will short-circuit as soon as it reaches the first false value because it then knows that not all the values are true.

If `and` and `or` do not *short-circuit*, they just return the last value; another way to remember this is that `and` and `or` always return the last thing they evaluate, whether they short circuit or not. Keep in mind that `and` and `or` don't always return booleans when using values other than `True` and `False`.

#### 2.2.3 If Statements
You can review the syntax of `if` statements in [Section 1.5.4](http://composingprograms.com/pages/15-control.html#conditional-statements) of Composing Programs.

> *Tip*: We sometimes see code that looks like this:
>
> ```python
> if x > 3:
>     return True
> else:
>     return False
> ```
> 
> This can be written more concisely as `return x > 3`. If your code looks like the code above, see if you can rewrite it more clearly!

#### 2.2.4 While Loops

You can review the syntax of `while` loops in [Section 1.5.5](http://composingprograms.com/pages/15-control.html#iteration) of Composing Programs.

### 2.3 Error Messages

By now, you've probably seen a couple of error messages. They might look intimidating, but error messages are very helpful for debugging code. The following are some common types of errors:

| Error Types | Descriptions |
| ---- | ---- |
| SyntaxError | Contained improper syntax (e.g. missing a colon after an `if` statement or forgetting to close parentheses/quotes) |
| IndentationError | Contained improper indentation (e.g. inconsistent indentation of a function body) |
| TypeError | Attempted operation on incompatible types (e.g. trying to add a function and a number) or called function with the wrong number of arguments |
| ZeroDivisionError | Attempted division by zero |

Using these descriptions of error messages, you should be able to get a better idea of what went wrong with your code. **If you run into error messages, try to identify the problem before asking for help.** You can often Google unfamiliar error messages to see if others have made similar mistakes to help you debug.

For example:

```
>>> square(3, 3)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: square() takes 1 positional argument but 2 were given
```

Note:

- The last line of an error message tells us the type of the error. In the example above, we have a `TypeError`.
- The error message tells us what we did wrong -- we gave `square` 2 arguments when it can only take in 1 argument. In general, the last line is the most helpful.
- The second to last line of the error message tells us on which line the error occurred. This helps us track down the error. In the example above, `TypeError` occurred at `line 1`.

## 3. What Would Python Display?

In this section, you need to think about what python would display if the code below were input to a python interpreter.

You don't have to submit your answers, which means the questions in this section don't count for your final score. However, they are great practice for future assignments, projects, and exams. Attempting these questions is valuable in helping cement your knowledge of course concepts.

To check the correctness of your answer, you can start a python interpreter, input the code into it, and compare the output displayed in the terminal with yours. It is ok for the interpreter to output nothing or raise an error.

### Question 1: Control

```python
>>> def xk(c, d):
...     if c == 4:
...         return 6
...     elif d >= 4:
...         return 6 + 7 + c
...     else:
...         return 25
>>> xk(10, 10)
______

>>> xk(10, 6)
______

>>> xk(4, 6)
______

>>> xk(0, 0)
______
```

```python
>>> def how_big(x):
...     if x > 10:
...         print('huge')
...     elif x > 5:
...         return 'big'
...     elif x > 0:
...         print('small')
...     else:
...         print("nothin'")
>>> how_big(7)
______

>>> how_big(12)
______

>>> how_big(1)
______

>>> how_big(-1)
______
```

```python
>>> n = 3
>>> while n >= 0:
...     n -= 1
...     print(n)
______
```

> Hint: Make sure your `while` loop conditions eventually evaluate to a false value, or they'll never stop! Typing `Ctrl-C` will stop infinite loops in the interpreter.

```python
>>> positive = 28
>>> while positive:
...     print("positive?")
...     positive -= 3
______
```

```python
>>> positive = -9
>>> negative = -12
>>> while negative:
...     if positive:
...         print(negative)
...     positive += 3
...     negative += 3
______
```

### Question 2: Veritasiness

```python
>>> True and 13
______

>>> False or 0
______

>>> not 10
______

>>> not None
______
```

```python
>>> True and 1 / 0 and False
______

>>> True or 1 / 0 or False
______

>>> True and 0
______

>>> False or 1
______

>>> 1 and 3 and 6 and 10 and 15
______

>>> 0 or False or 2 or 1 / 0
______
```

```python
>>> not 0
______

>>> (1 + 1) and 1
______

>>> 1/0 or True
______

>>> (True or False) and False
______
```

### Question 3: What If?

```python
>>> def ab(c, d):
...     if c > 5:
...         print(c)
...     elif c > 7:
...         print(d)
...     print('foo')
>>> ab(10, 20)
______
```

```python
>>> def bake(cake, make):
...     if cake == 0:
...         cake = cake + 1
...         print(cake)
...     if cake == 1:
...         print(make)
...     else:
...         return cake
...     return make
>>> bake(0, 29)
______

>>> bake(1, "mashed potatoes")
______
```
